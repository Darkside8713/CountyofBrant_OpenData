                    <h2>Data Acquisition and Processing</h2>
                    <p>The dataset to share on this open data portal was provided by the client through a geodatabase. Most fields were deemed necessary 
                        and those that were sensitive to share in public were processed once they were loaded onto ArcGIS Online, by hiding them through the use of views. 
                        Any additional modifications to public facing components (pop-ups, etc.) were modified through the map viewer through the published feature 
                        layer or feature layer views.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container containImage">
                        <img src="image\view.png" alt="Screenshot of settings to update feature layer view." class="responsive">
                        <p class="containerText">Hosted feature layer views can be used to share a modified instance of the feature layer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Methods to automate the loading of data onto ArcGIS Online were explored through FME and python scripting. During observation through 
                        ArcGIS Pro, many feature classes were found to have attachment tables connected through relationship classes. This area brought limitations 
                        and left room to explore further. A python script was created to load, publish, and update feature layers through a path to a geodatabase. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container containImage">

                    <h2>Creating Applications using ArcGIS Online</h2>
                    <p>Through research into existing examples and the literature, the application of datasets shared in an open data portal were found to be an important 
                        part of engaging public users to data.</p>
                    
                        <p> The StoryMap is an integral piece of our Open Data Portal. The Open Data Portal's StoryMap was developed using the ArcGIS StoryMap product, 
                            which provides a variety of interactive widgets for users to engage with. To ensure visual consistency with the rest of the hub, a custom 
                            theme was meticulously crafted for the StoryMap, aligning its design seamlessly with the overall aesthetics of the platform. The published 
                            StoryMap was subsequently integrated into the main page of our ArcGIS Hub, where it takes on a prominent role as the centerpiece of the platform. 
                            This strategic placement ensures that the StoryMap captures the attention of users, providing them with valuable and engaging information right from the hub's main page.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Creating the Open Data Portal using ArcGIS Hub</h2>
                    <p>ArcGIS Hub was used to create the public platform. Beyond the default configuration provided by the Hub, the design of the portal was 
                        configured in hopes to stray away from the common visuals of open data portals created using ArcGIS Hub, while maintaining accessbility for its users. 
                        This process required the use of HTML and CSS along with the edit settings provided through the platform.
